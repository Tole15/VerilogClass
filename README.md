# VerilogClass 💻🔌

> Notes, resources, and projects on Verilog Digital Design.

Welcome to my Verilog Digital Design repository. This space contains a structured collection of practices, theoretical documentation, and hardware implementation files focused on digital systems design using Verilog HDL.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized by practical assignments and supporting materials:

* **`Prac1/` to `Prac4/`**: Progressive hands-on Verilog practices. These folders contain the RTL code, project files, and specific implementations for different digital design labs.
* **`docs/`**: Supporting documentation, reference materials, and theoretical notes for the practices.
* **`hardware/`**: Files related to the physical implementation, such as pin assignments and documentation specific to the target FPGA/CPLD boards used in these designs.
* **`testcat/`**: Testbench files and testing catalogs used to simulate and verify the RTL modules before hardware deployment.

## 🛠️ Tools & Development

These projects are developed using standard digital design workflows, primarily utilizing **Intel Quartus Prime** for synthesis and implementation, along with simulation tools for RTL verification.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Tole15/VerilogClass.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired practice folder (e.g., `Prac1/`).

3. Open the project in **Quartus Prime** (or another HDL development environment) to view the source code, synthesize the design, and run simulations.

4. Refer to the `docs/` directory for theoretical background, notes, and additional instructions.
